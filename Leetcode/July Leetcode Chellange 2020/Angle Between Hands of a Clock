Given two numbers, hour and minutes. Return the smaller angle (in degrees) formed between the hour and the minute hand.

 

Example 1:



Input: hour = 12, minutes = 30
Output: 165
Example 2:



Input: hour = 3, minutes = 30
Output: 75
Example 3:



Input: hour = 3, minutes = 15
Output: 7.5
Example 4:

Input: hour = 4, minutes = 50
Output: 155
Example 5:

Input: hour = 12, minutes = 0
Output: 0
 

Constraints:

1 <= hour <= 12
0 <= minutes <= 59
Answers within 10^-5 of the actual value will be accepted as correct.
   Hide Hint #1  
The tricky part is determining how the minute hand affects the position of the hour hand.
   Hide Hint #2  
Calculate the angles separately then find the difference.


Solution

class Solution {
    public double angleClock(int hour, int minutes) {
        if(hour == 12)
            hour = 0;
        double min =  6*minutes;
       // double hou = 30*hour +(minutes/2);//  wrong one
        double hou = 30*hour +(minutes/2.0); // right one 
        return Math.min(Math.abs(min-hou),360-Math.abs(min- hou));
    }
}
